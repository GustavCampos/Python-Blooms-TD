We made this decision to protect our code from being used by individuals or companies to create similar experiences to the original game,
with the intention of making money through the sale of microtransactions or the complete game.
This is necessary to ensure that our project does not infringe on Ninja Kiwi's copyright rights over the Bloons TD franchise and its assets.

In the future, we may fork this into a proper TD creator to ensure a completely FOSS licensing.
